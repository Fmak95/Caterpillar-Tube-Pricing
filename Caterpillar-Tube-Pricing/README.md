# Caterpillar-Tube-Pricing

This competition is about to predict each tube pricing based on detailed data such as tube assembly, components, annual volume and so on. For the training set, there are around 30K rows you can use to train your model, and the final test set has roughly the same amount you need to predict. The final judgement is based on Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE) as evaluation metrics.
